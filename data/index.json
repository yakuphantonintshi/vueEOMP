        "I am an aspiring developer at Life Choices. I went to COSAT High School where I was introduced to IT or coding space. I reside in a small township called Khayelitsha. I live with my parents and my two brothers. I saw that not much students or learners are well informed about the coding space so I want to bring some change in townships. I graduated at Nelson Mandela University, where I was majoting in the Psychology field.Out of the programming languages I did so far, I would say HTML and CSS are my favourite. I got into this field out of curiosity and wanting to learn more on the IT industry or field."
