        "Hello, I am Yakupha Ntonintshi.I was born and raised in a small township called Khayelitsha in Cape Town. I live with both my parents and my two brothers. I am the only girl at home.
         My passion for web developer started when I applied at Life Choices. I only had an IT background, where I was doing one programming language which was Delphi, which also added an impact in me loving everything about coding.
